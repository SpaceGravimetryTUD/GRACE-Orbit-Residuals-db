# GRACE Geospatial Data Processing Stack

This project sets up a scalable geospatial data processing pipeline using **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Docker Compose**. It facilitates efficient ingestion, validation, and querying of high-frequency satellite data from the GRACE mission.¬†

## üåç Context & Background

We work with high-frequency geospatial time-series data from the GRACE satellite mission, specifically Level-1B range-rate residuals derived from inter-satellite Ka-band observations. These residuals may contain unexploited high-frequency geophysical signals used for scientific applications.

### Key dataset characteristics:

- Temporal resolution: 5-second intervals
- Geospatial attributes: Latitude, longitude, altitude for two satellites (GRACE A & B)
- Data volume: 2002‚Äì2017, \~6.3 million records per year (\~95 million total)
- Queries of interest: Filtering by time span, spatial regions, and signal characteristics (statistical analysis)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

This project is designed to run in a Unix environment. If you are using a Windows machine, we recommend installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and following the steps recommended for Linux/Ubuntu.

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for development; see note below on production use)
  - [Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [Docker Compose standalone on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/#on-linux)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** package manager

> **Note:** We recommend installing Docker Engine & Docker Compose using the Linux/Ubuntu installation guides, even when using WSL2, rather than using Docker Desktop. This ensures compatibility with the steps below.

> **Production Use:** We recommend using **Podman** instead of Docker for production environments, as it is compatible with Docker commands and provides better security and rootless containerization. We plan to migrate fully to Podman in the future.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Database with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This launches a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS support.

Verify the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the Database

To create tables, run:

```bash
poetry run python
>>> import src.models
>>> src.models.init_db()
>>> exit()
```

Verify the database schema inside PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d geospatial_db -c "\d satellite_data;"
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Connect to PostgreSQL

```bash
docker exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d geospatial_db
```
