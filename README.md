# GRACE Geospatial Data Processing Stack

This project sets up a scalable geospatial data processing pipeline using **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Podman Compose**. It facilitates efficient ingestion, validation, and querying of high-frequency satellite data from the GRACE mission.¬†

## üåç Context & Background

We work with high-frequency geospatial time-series data from the GRACE satellite mission, specifically Level-1B range-rate residuals derived from inter-satellite Ka-band observations. These residuals may contain unexploited high-frequency geophysical signals used for scientific applications.

### Key dataset characteristics:

- Temporal resolution: 5-second intervals
- Geospatial attributes: Latitude, longitude, altitude for two satellites (GRACE A & B)
- Data volume: 2002‚Äì2017, \~6.3 million records per year (\~95 million total)
- Queries of interest: Filtering by time span, spatial regions, and signal characteristics (statistical analysis)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

This project is designed to run in a Unix environment. If you are using a Windows machine, we recommend installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and following the steps recommended for Linux/Ubuntu.

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Podman** 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install podman
podman machine init
```
- **Python 3.10+**
- **pip** package manager
- **Poetry 2.+**
  - [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

 > **Note**: We recommend using **Podman** instead of **Docker** for production environments, as it is compatible with Docker commands and provides better security and rootless containerization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpaceGravimetryTUD/GRACE-Orbit-Residuals-db/tree/main
cd GRACE-Orbit-Residuals-db
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies and activate virtual environment

```bash
poetry install
. .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the TimescaleDB Docker image

```bash
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg14-oss-latest
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Database with Podman Compose

```bash
podman-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This launches a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS support.

Verify the container is running:

```bash
podman ps
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Enable the PostGIS extension

```bash
podman exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d geospatial_db -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
```

### 7 Set file location for data to be uploaded into the database

For demonstration purposes we are going to use the following file:

'''bash
data/flat-data-test.pkl
''' 

### 8 ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

To run the project locally ‚Äî including the tests ‚Äî you need to create a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file should define the necessary environment variables for database access and test data.

#### Required variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: the full SQLAlchemy connection string to the PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL instance
- `TEST_DATA_PATH`: path to the `.pkl` file used for inserting sample satellite data during testing

#### üìÑ Example `.env` file

```ini
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/geospatial_db
TEST_DATA_PATH=data/flat-data-test.pkl
```

Make sure the database container is running (e.g., via `podman-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d`) before running any scripts or tests.

### 9 Initialize the Database

To create and populate tables, run `poetry run python` and then:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/init_db.py 
```

Verify the database schema inside PostgreSQL:

```bash
podman exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d geospatial_db -c "\d kbr_gravimetry;"
```

To display data uploaded into the table kbr_gravimetry:

```bash
podman exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d geospatial_db -c "TABLE  kbr_gravimetry"
```


### 10 (Optional) Restart the Database with Podman Compose

If for any reason you intend to restart the database from scratch, you can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
podman-compose down
podman volume rm grace-orbit-residuals-db_postgres_data
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention**: If database is populated, the data stored in the database will be permanently lost with this step. 


### üß™ Running Tests (Requires Local Database)

Before running the test suite, you **must ensure that the PostgreSQL + PostGIS database is running locally** and properly initialized.

The tests are designed to validate the data ingestion, model behavior, and query logic against a real database backend, not mocks or in-memory databases.

After following the steps above to set up the database, you can run the tests using:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Tests will fail if the database is not running or not properly initialized. Ensure the `satellite_data` table exists and is populated with test data.
