# GRACE Geospatial Data Processing Stack

This project sets up a scalable geospatial data pipeline using **PostgreSQL + PostGIS + TimescaleDB** , **SQLAlchemy**, and **Podman Compose**. It facilitates efficient ingestion, validation, and querying of high-frequency satellite data from the GRACE mission.

---

## 🌍 Context & Background

We work with high-frequency geospatial time-series data from the GRACE satellite mission, specifically Level-1B range-rate residuals derived from inter-satellite Ka-band observations. These residuals may contain unexploited high-frequency geophysical signals used for scientific applications.

### Key dataset characteristics:

- **Temporal resolution**: 5-second intervals
- **Spatial attributes**: Latitude, longitude, altitude for GRACE A & B
- **Data volume**: 2002–2017, approx. \~95 million records
- **Target queries**: Time-span filtering, spatial bounding, and signal-based statistical analysis

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

This project targets Unix-based systems. If you're on Windows, install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and proceed as if on Ubuntu.

Install the following tools:

- **Podman & Podman Compose**
  - [Podman Install](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
  - [Podman Compose Install](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **pip**
- **[Poetry 2.x](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)**

> 🔐 **Security Note**: Podman is recommended over Docker for production due to rootless container support.

> 📅 **Docker Compatibility**: You can also use Docker for development or local testing if it's already installed on your system. Podman supports Docker CLI syntax, so most `docker` and `docker-compose` commands are interchangeable with `podman` and `podman-compose`.

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpaceGravimetryTUD/GRACE-Orbit-Residuals-db
cd GRACE-Orbit-Residuals-db
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start the Database

```bash
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
podman ps
```

---

### 4️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

From now on, run all Python commands via:

```bash
poetry run <your-command>
```

---

### 5️⃣ Environment Configuration
Make sure to have a data directory where you store your data.

> ⚠️ Security Note on Pickle Files
> Warning: This application loads data using pandas.read_pickle(), which internally uses Python's pickle module.

While this format is convenient for fast internal data loading, it is not secure against untrusted input.Never upload or load .pkl files from unverified or external sources, as they can execute arbitrary code on your system.



Create a `.env` file at the project root:

```ini
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/geospatial_db
DATA_PATH=data/flat-data-test.pkl
```

Ensure the database is running (`podman-compose up -d`) before using scripts.

---
### 6️⃣ (Optional) Enable PostGIS Extension

If needed, you can manually enable PostGIS (only once):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

---

### 7️⃣ Initialize the Database Schema with Alembic

This project uses Alembic for database migrations. Initialize the schema:

```bash
# Generate initial migration
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Edit the generated migration file
# The migration may include `op.drop_table('spatial_ref_sys')` due to PostGIS system tables
# Comment out or remove any lines that drop PostGIS system tables like:
# - spatial_ref_sys
# - geography_columns  
# - geometry_columns
```

# Apply the migration
```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```
Future Enhancement: The PostGIS system table issue could be resolved by implementing schema-based separation or improving the Alembic configuration to automatically exclude PostGIS system tables.
---

### 8️⃣ Load Sample Data
This will create the tables and load initial data:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/init_db.py --use_batches --filepath <path to flat data file>
```
If you get the error:
`Failed to initialize database: No module named 'src'`
then you are in the wrong directory.
# Optional: verify schema from inside the container:
```bash
bashpodman exec -it postgis_container psql -U user -d $DATABASE_NAME -c "\d $TABLE_NAME;"
```

The variables $DATABASE_NAME and $TABLE_NAME are defined in .env.
---
### 9️⃣ Insert & Query Example Data

Ensure `data/flat-data-test.pkl` exists:

```bash
ls data/flat-data-test.pkl
```

Run a sample query:

```bash
poetry run python
```

Then in Python:

```python
from scripts.first_query import run_firstquery
run_firstquery()
```

---


## Restart or Clean the Database (Optional)

To completely reset:

```bash
podman-compose down
podman volume rm grace-orbit-residuals-db_postgres_data
```

> ⚠️ Warning: This will **permanently delete all data** inside the database.

---

## 📊 Running Tests

Tests rely on a running local database and valid `.env` configuration.

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

> ✅ Ensure:
> - `geospatial_db` is running.
> - `kbr_gravimetry` table exists.
> - Sample data is loaded.
